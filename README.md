This is group B's coursework submission for SET08403 2020-1 TR2 001.

Evidence to show completion of objectives:

1. ID of the requirement.
2. Name of the requirement.
3. Has the requirement been met (Yes or No).
4. Screenshot.

PLEASE NOTE: We have identified:

    The population of the world.
    The population of a continent.
    The population of a region.
    The population of a country.
    The population of a district.
    The population of a city.

as one use case

but identified:


    Chinese.
    English.
    Hindi.
    Spanish.
    Arabic.

speakers as separate use cases rather than the other way around. 

As such we have 31 use cases in our project instead of 32. 
Thus use case 32 is failed as we didn't sort by the total speakers since we generated 
the reports separately

All functionality for all 32 is still present and presented still though, which I'll show below but it wont order
between the 5 as expected.
